# REDM
Real Estate Deal Marketplace

It is like reddit for real estate deal discussions. Users can post theirs' deals and get feedback from other users on how they did.

Considering how biggerpockets has became a public cesspool. I create this website so that it can be utilized as a good way for experienced RE operators to help the noobs.

// For me //

Focus on implementing more features. For example, user can input some basic info like total revenue => use a ratio like 50% for expense to spit out a net operating income (without factoring in debt payments) => The cancluate the cap rate for the property;

Then other users go in and help with analyzing the deals. Told that it is absolute shit or w/e. => implement a thumbs up or down feature for each review so that someone can go in , and just like reddit, can upvote or down vote a comment.

Change some themes in the navbar so that the projects do not look so bootstrapy.

Implement a map so that deals can be shown on the map.

Preferably let user sort the listing from low cap rate to high cap rate or purchase price.
